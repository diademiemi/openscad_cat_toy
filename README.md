![Cat Toy](./preview.png)

This is a simple print in place cat toy. The truncated icosahedron is generated at [http://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/solid-index.xq](http://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/solid-index.xq). 

The toy is printed in place, with a ball inside of an outer ball that can rattle around, this makes it more fun for the cats!
